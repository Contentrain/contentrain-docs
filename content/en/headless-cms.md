## What is Headless CMS 

A headless Content Management System, or headless CMS, is a back-end-only content management system that acts primarily as a content repository. A headless CMS makes content accessible via an API for display on any device without a built-in, front-end, or presentation layer. The term “headless” comes from the concept of chopping the “head” (the front end) off the “body” (the back end).

## What is Git-Based  Headless CMS 

Developers are accustomed to using Version Control Systems in their projects. Thanks to these systems, it is possible to create versions in software projects, work on branches, manage "Continues Integration - Continues Development" CI/CD processes seamlessly and ultimately increase productivity. Git-based content management systems allow you to dynamically manage content stored on "Git" within the code stack. This provides a more flexible CMS experience for content creators while providing the scalability, cost, security and maintainability provided by GIT for developers.
