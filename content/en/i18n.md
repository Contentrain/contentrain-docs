i18n (Localization) is where you add any language to each of your collections.

![localization](/images/i18n.png)

To add a new language click **Select a language** on the collection and click **Save Changes**.

For example, if you add **English** and **Deutch** languages, **Contentrain** will create the **/en** and **/de** folder paths in your JSON database structure.

In addition, when a language is added to a language that has not been added before, you need to choose the default language.
